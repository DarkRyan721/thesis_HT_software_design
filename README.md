## Overview

This repository provides an advanced, open-source simulation tool for the analysis and design of **SPT-100 Hall Effect Thrusters**. Developed in Python, the software integrates state-of-the-art scientific libraries such as **FEniCSx** for finite element field solvers, **PyVista** for 3D visualization, and **Gmsh** for automated mesh generation.

The tool features a modular, extensible architecture with a professional GUI (PySide6), empowering both academic researchers and industry engineers to study the complex plasma, electromagnetic, and kinetic phenomena inherent to Hall effect thrusters.

---

## Motivation

The increasing adoption of electric propulsion in both commercial and scientific satellites demands reliable, transparent, and flexible simulation tools. Most existing high-fidelity simulators are either proprietary or highly restricted, limiting access for research groups, universities, and small enterprises.

**This project addresses that gap by providing an open, verifiable, and customizable solution, enabling the exploration and optimization of thruster designs beyond the constraints of closed software.**

---

## Features

- **3D Geometry Generator:** Parametric mesh construction of SPT-100-like thrusters using Gmsh, fully customizable.
- **Electrostatic Field Solver:** Finite Element Method (FEM) solvers for Poisson and Laplace equations (FEniCSx).
- **Magnetic Field Module:** Calculation of solenoidal magnetic fields (Biot-Savart law) with flexible coil geometry.
- **Particle-In-Cell (PIC) Engine:** Kinetic simulation of ion and electron trajectories, supporting full 3D dynamics.
- **Monte Carlo Collisions (MCC):** Stochastic modeling of plasma ionization and neutralization events.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Interactive 3D field, mesh, and particle renderings via PyVista, including field lines, density maps, and trajectories.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Intuitive, multi-panel PySide6-based GUI for configuration, execution, and result analysis.
- **Benchmark Validation:** Comparison with NASA SPT-100 data and other standard reference cases.
- **Open Architecture:** Fully documented, extensible Python code, designed for community contributions.

## System Architecture

<!-- If you have an architecture diagram, add it here. Example: -->
<!-- ![System Diagram](docs/system_architecture.png) -->

The workflow consists of the following modular components:

1. **Mesh Generation:** Geometry definition and mesh export (Gmsh, `mesh_generator.py`).
2. **Electrostatic Field Solution:** Laplace/Poisson field calculation (`electron_density_model.py`, FEniCSx).
3. **Magnetic Field Calculation:** Computational analytical magnetic field solver.
4. **Particle Simulation:** 3D PIC-MCC engine for plasma evolution.
5. **Visualization:** 3D post-processing and interactive analysis.
6. **GUI:** User input, monitoring, and batch simulation control.
